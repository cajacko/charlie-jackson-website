Our main product was Photine, a range of smarter digital photo frames. The problem here was that people love photos and over 90% of people display photos in some way  at home. However existing digital photo frames are perceived as ugly, a pain to update and lack in variety and creativity. Our idea was to create the first ever multiple screen digital photo frames, that are wifi enabled to gather your latest photos automatically, and have advanced smart features. The project resulted in us creating a series of 3 separate digital photo frames models. A 1 screen, 3 screen and 4 screen. The multiple screen devices were instantly unique for their collage like layout and beautiful wooden design. ![Photine digital photo frames design image](//images.contentful.com/1gvc9x9hfuhs/6LXj25HFdYc4u2cqwwy2OC/59b99094f5d46323f341ae131c2cb21c/photine-digital-photo-frames-design.png) The frames could connect to your photos on Facebook, google drive, Dropbox and from your local computer and would automatically figure out which photos to show based on like count, who's tagged in the photos, dates, locations etc. So the user doesn't have to tediously pick albums to display. The smart features included:\n\n*   Whose at home: let the frames know who is coming over, so it will pick pictures where there people are tagged in them\n*   Push to frame: Push a photo from your mobile device directly to the frame\n*   Smart selection: Photine automatically displays photos for you based of their popularity, location and the people in the photos.\n\nDuring the project we raised over 5 thousand pounds in finance, won 2 competitions and shortlisted for 3 more and ran an unsuccessful [crowdfunding campaign](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/photine-smarter-better-connected-digital-photo-frames#/) that taught us more than anything. ![Photine digital photo frames with app image](//images.contentful.com/1gvc9x9hfuhs/5ic2RV73nG0sYaQmMgKiyS/6b182c7e41ae00b12a09b5b25eae2508/photine-digital-photo-frames-app.png)","tags":["5rYKGVnhOoE6c2QYSqsQkg","56sMROF82suwMsq8siYMac"],"categories":["3CSGxQc2WsCWoYauKcq68g","1shdGmOD4Ago2Se2mKu4MK","Oop22YBsUEUEske6kmAUO","6Prj0oBP3OAue8UwSMKAaq","15ut4Vz1Iu486CWCSmGW8o"]},"2KpgeADoGQ80WmK0Gq86YC":{"id":"2KpgeADoGQ80WmK0Gq86YC","createdAt":"2017-07-17T16:57:27.462Z","updatedAt":"2017-07-17T16:57:27.462Z","contentType":"project","title":"TedX UCL Talk - Designing Future Homes","slug":"tedx","displayDate":"2013-06-10T13:04:46.000Z","thumbnailImage":"5wPEbsmr1SwoCoIgwuMu0G","excerpt":"Our homes are changing.

Connected products and advancements in technology are bringing in a new era of adaptive and smart products into our homes. The ramifications of these trends have an important impact on how we will want to design and innovate these new generation of products. Software has been excellent at letting us personalise devices, but when these current and future trends start really transforming the home will we want the same level of personalisation in our hardware products?\n\n## Profile Description:\n\nCharlie is an engineering graduate in product design and manufacture.

I designed these during my last year studying [Product Design and Manufacture at the University of Nottingham](http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/ugstudy/courses/mechanicalmaterialsandmanufacturingengineering/beng-product-design-manufacture.aspx). The range includes a pendant, wall, floor and table light designed with a common dome aesthetic and matching chrome plated finishes. The products can all be controlled by usual ways, either your existing wired switches for the pendant and wall light or the built in switches on the floor and table light. However they can join your existing wi-fi network and can then allow a whole host of new features:\n\n*   Control all aspects of the lights from your smart phone, tablet or computer.\n*   Apply one change and all the lights in a room or even the whole house can change at the same time.\n*   Control includes:\n    *   On/off\n    *   Brightness\n    *   Colour\n    *   Moving patterns (e.g. Switching colours over time, pulsating etc.)\n*   Set up automated features which are controlled and processed by cloud computing (on remote servers across the internet):\n    *   To change depending on the time of day (could turn on in the evening, gradually get brighter throughout the day etc.)\n    *   Be less bright when turned on late at night (especially useful if going to the bathroom at night)\n*   Learn about you:\n    *   Your daily lighting routines can be recorded so that if you go on holiday you can set the lights to turn on and off as if you were at home.\n    *   Saves your commonly used colours, moods and theme settings for easy recollection.\n*   New features are available instantly over the internet\n\n![Lumine explainer image](//images.contentful.com/1gvc9x9hfuhs/6z3aFyDWBGIIUO6GccqUgq/393247593fdcb5a3086334acd64982ba/lumine-explainer-image.jpg) The products utilise an RGB LED screw fit bulb which offers long life and low energy usage. The products work normally as soon as they are plugged in or wired. To connect them to the network you have to install the relevant app for the smartphone, tablet or computer or you could just visit the specified IP address in any internet browser on the network. Within the app it can scan for available devices and assign them to the specific rooms. If there are problems the lights can be reset and disconnected from the network by locating and holding down the reset switch, found on each light, for 5 seconds, this will then cause the lights to flash. One of the main benefits of the products is that they still work on their own or more can be added to the network to greatly improve the experience.\n\n## System of Integration\n\nFurther concepts in the product offering which were briefly developed include a touch screen control panel, a SMART hub and a wi-fi RGB LED bulb.\n\n### Control Panel\n\nThe control panel can be retro fit instead of the existing wall switches and offers all the functions as the control app but from the convenience of where your existing switches were. It includes several physical switches for intuitive on/off control. Especially for guests. The inclusion of a proximity sensor means the screen only turns on when something is moving close to it. The control panel also has a camera and microphone which can be used to add further automated features to the system:\n\n*   Turn on/off the lights with movement around the house.\n*   Control through voice\n*   Could change colours and moods in reaction to sounds or movement.\n\n### SMART Hub\n\nThe SMART hub can act as it’s own wi-fi router of join an existing network. It can then do all the processing instead of the could computing. Resulting in automated features even if the internet is offline. It also has a built in hard drive for backing up computers wirelessly.\n\n### RGB wifi LED Bulb\n\nThe RGB wifi LED bulb allows you to connect your existing lights to the network. Just use this bulb instead, set it up though the app and all the SMART features are available. This bulb would be very expensive and due to the need to replace bulbs, even though LED’s last a long time, it is not as sustainable a solution as the connectivity being in the fixings. ![Lumine Buble pendant light](//images.contentful.com/1gvc9x9hfuhs/64KL3GIxxei0uoMwuUY4Ce/eaf19efd8e564ca6c3aa1192b38733eb/lumine-buble.jpg)\n\n### The Wider Context\n\nThe technology used in the lights could be licensed to other designers and manufacturers in order to create more affordable lights in many different styles. The fittings themselves could be sold to use with existing shades or wi-fi power adapters could be plugged into existing lights to add connectivity. Being wi-fi connected lights these products have the potential of communicating with other SMART devices around the home. These includes:\n\n*   Linking with a SMART TV in order to react to certain events (e.g. Become dimmer when a film is playing)\n*   Connect with a music system (e.g. When playing music through iTunes the lights could react and pulsate to the type of music if you want.)\n*   Connect to the doorbell. This could have huge benefits for deaf people as the lights could flash when the doorbell rings. Also if speakers are connected to the same system they could fade down the music and play the doorbell sound.\n*   React to the fire alarm. The lights could flash if the alarm goes off.\n*   Separate sensor units could be purchased to place throughout the house as desired and be utilised by the lights to turn on before someone enters a room and to automatically turn off where no one is.\n\n### Related Product Ideas for the Company\n\n*   Standard fittings for other manufactures to easily utilise in their designs.\n*   Standard fittings for consumers to connect existing lighting.\n*   Wi-fi power adapters/sockets.\n*   Further lighting ranges.\n*   Connected speakers, fire alarms, doorbells, TV’s, security cameras, blinds, kitchen appliances and utility management.\n*   Sensor units for the home, to give data to the appliances.","tags":["3uq1OiURL2Emome0aii20c","25thetwt7momiQkk88W0U6"],"categories":["1shdGmOD4Ago2Se2mKu4MK","6Prj0oBP3OAue8UwSMKAaq","15ut4Vz1Iu486CWCSmGW8o"]},"686PC0T4jYKimwuaq6AeQw":{"id":"686PC0T4jYKimwuaq6AeQw","createdAt":"2017-07-17T16:57:26.475Z","updatedAt":"2017-07-17T16:57:26.475Z","contentType":"project","title":"Social Helper","slug":"socialhelper","displayDate":"2017-01-30T21:30:28.000Z","thumbnailImage":"1iLPDjurusm2WS06cI6SMK","excerpt":"Social Helper is a tool that automates your social media profiles.

It is a tool that automates your social media profiles, as I am useless and keeping up with posting. I'm working on this for 2 weeks and have a few goals I need to achieve and some stretch goals that would be nice if I have enough time.\n\n## Critical Goals:\n\n*   Create a service that automatically retweets the most popular tweets given a twitter search query\n*   The time a tweet should get sent out is based on a user specified cron\n*   Multiple user accounts should be able to use the service\n*   Multiple search queries should be given for one account, and be evenly tweeted about\n*   The service should make sure it doesn't tweet the same thing, or tweet too much from the same user\n\n## Stretch Goals\n\n*   The service should be managed through a web interface\n*   The service should track the amount of followers on the Twitter account every day, so it can measure effectiveness of posting\n*   Each Twitter user should get a weekly performance report so they can adjust their settings\n\nThe current work I am doing on this project is part of a bigger idea that I may come back to from time to time. The bigger idea would be a more developed service including features like:\n\n*   Integrating with your website to suggest or automatically share old and new content\n*   Connecting to your personal photos, scanning through them, and suggesting things to put on Instagram/Pinterest\n    *   Also a service that does this by looking through your project folders\n*   Finding and suggesting conversations you should interact with on Twitter in real time\n*   Automatically adjusting what to Tweet/Retweet based on the performance of past tweets","tags":["61Vxvs1JJuAeiqKMQIeEIw"],"categories":["3CSGxQc2WsCWoYauKcq68g","5VIUyoyN44uGc24uqs8EYq"]},"2Pm8NiT4juwEk0We2Wu8E8":{"id":"2Pm8NiT4juwEk0We2Wu8E8","createdAt":"2017-07-17T16:57:26.461Z","updatedAt":"2017-07-17T16:57:26.461Z","contentType":"project","title":"DataLight - Connected Light for the Workplace","slug":"datalight","displayDate":"2015-02-03T13:48:07.000Z","thumbnailImage":"rx6itYIETekO0OUsgwqg8","excerpt":"DataLight is a connected light for the workplace that lets you visualise data with movement and ambient light.

Having done a design degree and Viki an art degree we wanted to do a lot of the planning and decoration ourselves. Having the reception at my parents place in Suffolk was the clear choice, there was enough space for a big marquee and the surrounding buildings look fucking awesome. We liked the idea of hosting it in a marquee as it would act as a blank canvas for us to do what we wanted inside it. With that sorted we started looking for ceremony venues around Thorpeness and as soon as we found Glemham Hall it became the obvious solution. An impressive old mansion house with amazing grounds and a grass tennis court for me and the groomsmen to play on in the morning. We decided to design the invites ourselves. Viki drew both Glemham Hall and my parents house, I then took these and digitized them, adding shading and tidying them up on Photoshop. Making the seating plan was some of the most fun we had (apart from the wedding day I guess). We got a large board, some paint, speakers and a crate of Corona, went out into the woods and proceeded to get very messy and drunk in the sunshine making a crazy paint mess on the board. The day before the wedding we then overlaid the table plan. Inside the marquee we used 2 kilometres of different coloured ribbon and strung it up from the center to the sides. Taking absolutely ages, but totally worth it in the end. Now we have loads of left over ribbon if you need to borrow some?

With this in mind I set upon looking at why the paperless office never came about. The final design is a notebook that consists of 2 high resolution touch screens that are hinged together and a separate set of colour e-ink pages which can magnetically attach to the main notepad. This product gives you some of the main benefits that working with paper does, like spreading out pages so you can quickly reference multiple documents, whilst adding in the best of technology, such as continuous file/note saving and sharing work across the internet. Truly helping to bring about that fabled paperless office. What I really enjoyed about this project was how my user research became more about observational work rather than focus groups or interviews. I spent hours in offices, libraries and classrooms observing the different ways people use paper and occasional asking why someone would do something in a certain way. As the project was titled Tomorrow’s Workplace this is a near future concept and hopefully we might see similar products appear in the next few years as developments with colour e-ink displays become cheaper and more widespread.","categories":["1shdGmOD4Ago2Se2mKu4MK","6Prj0oBP3OAue8UwSMKAaq"]},"1SGMtILaG88mI2K4UgC6QO":{"id":"1SGMtILaG88mI2K4UgC6QO","createdAt":"2017-07-17T16:57:10.586Z","updatedAt":"2017-07-17T16:57:10.586Z","contentType":"project","title":"Global Commands - NPM Module to run commonly used commands","slug":"globalcommands","displayDate":"2016-11-21T13:47:17.000Z","thumbnailImage":"Llaabd64I88gCkie0CKue","excerpt":"Run commands from any directory.

Nineline is an online timeline that helps you track trends and predictions. The idea was heavily inspired the work of Richard Watson and the timelines he created during his futurology research. When doing my BEng in product design and manufacture, my dissertation was on the future of home design. I read a lot of futurist literature and created a giant pinboard to track trends and predictions. This is the digitisation of this pin board. Nineline is a WordPress based website that uses jQuery to position elements across the canvas. The current incarnation uses the Bootstrap framework, which made it much easier to get a decent looking site up and running quickly. The goal of Nineline is to help people plan ahead with their own products and businesses, to see what changes may be occurring and how to act accordingly. On the site I aim to allow people to add in their own predictions, track topics that interest them and engage with interesting predictions or articles.","tags":["22wEpeq6Y0wisYkqceqgoo","ttsqnOMioCAK2IAuCuW82","nTeLKqN27IIEUu0ioSCic"],"categories":["3CSGxQc2WsCWoYauKcq68g","2e9R8diSf60MAaaWAyWMcS","Oop22YBsUEUEske6kmAUO","5VIUyoyN44uGc24uqs8EYq"]},"1GE8iKIiEEYioa0KE4wIQ2":{"id":"1GE8iKIiEEYioa0KE4wIQ2","createdAt":"2017-07-17T16:57:09.817Z","updatedAt":"2017-07-17T16:57:09.817Z","contentType":"project","title":"Product Stories - Podcast Where You Find Out How Great Products Are Made","slug":"productstories","displayDate":"2015-02-28T16:19:07.000Z","thumbnailImage":"RVCzDpOxIO2CmIu8CqokK","excerpt":"Product Stories is an online TV show and podcast that I produced for Graftt.

I was tasked with redesigning a bus shelter. I’ve always known that the best solutions come from a great understanding of the problem and people’s behaviours so I sucked up the courage to go out and figure out the buses in a new city, always a daunting task. I ended up spending days riding the bus, getting off at stops, observing what people were doing and asking various questions and opinions. The problems mainly came down to a lack of space and grubby or ugly designs. I therefore took it upon myself that Nottingham really needed a new striking design referencing some of the architectural beauties around the city, with a modular construction so that various layouts could be built for more or less popular locations. I always like including this initial project in my portfolio as it reminds me of the satisfaction and pleasure I took out of completing my first design project as a university student. I also think it is an interesting example of my own design style, I’m a particular fan of offset angles and the contrast of introducing curves, as seen in this design.","tags":["3uq1OiURL2Emome0aii20c","25thetwt7momiQkk88W0U6"],"categories":["6dDdjcgUneMUWiGK2EmyyU","6Prj0oBP3OAue8UwSMKAaq"]},"64MM1JZ9wAIsaQ06oUY8ys":{"id":"64MM1JZ9wAIsaQ06oUY8ys","createdAt":"2017-07-17T16:57:09.639Z","updatedAt":"2017-07-17T16:57:09.639Z","contentType":"project","title":"Kitchen Block - A Modern Day Hostess Trolley","slug":"kitchen-block-a-modern-day-hostess-trolley","displayDate":"2010-11-13T13:45:40.000Z","thumbnailImage":"1vhAJ50kmM8aUgsCMIS20y","excerpt":"Whilst studying product design at Nottingham I was tasked with redesigning a domestic hostess trolley.

I often had issues when asked to redesign a product, as I prefer to think about the root problem and new or better ways to solve it rather than being asked to improve an existing solution. However with regards to hostess trolleys I found that problems still existed when you have people over for food; you can often run out of preparation space, quite often you want to keep more drinks cold than you have space in the fridge and there can still be the problem of needing somewhere to keep some dishes/food warm. So my solution is a portable kitchen block that has a top surface you can prepare food on, a lower surface for temporarily placing utensils, and an insulated compartment for keeping food/drink warm or cold for longer. This is a design whose chopping surface now makes it a product to use everyday rather than the rarely used traditional hostess trolleys. With this project we were also told we could not use our 3D modelling software or rendering package so these visuals were done using Photoshop and Illustrator.","tags":["3uq1OiURL2Emome0aii20c","25thetwt7momiQkk88W0U6"],"categories":["6Prj0oBP3OAue8UwSMKAaq"]},"1t08x12qIAEmgGUgmKUcys":{"id":"1t08x12qIAEmgGUgmKUcys","createdAt":"2017-07-17T16:57:09.596Z","updatedAt":"2017-07-17T16:57:09.596Z","contentType":"project","title":"Mobile Market Stall - Product Design Group Project at Uni","slug":"marketstall","displayDate":"2011-05-13T16:06:07.000Z","thumbnailImage":"3vAh5kP7ZeOSMgGicCycwM","excerpt":"This was my first full group design project studying Product Design, to design a mobile market stall, exciting stuff.","content":"![Mobile Market Stall](//images.contentful.com/1gvc9x9hfuhs/3vAh5kP7ZeOSMgGicCycwM/ebf74ef06dd02570131fbf19cea925a5/mobile-market-stall.jpg) This was my first full group design project, to design a mobile market stall.

The cup was to have superior stability for unusual and rough situations. The main focus of this project however was the manufacturability of it. It had to be designed out of 3 or less parts and be injection moulded on a specific type of machine. We were asked to consider all the limitations of the process and to create detailed engineering drawings of the product. This project was a really good insight into the amount of technical problems and considerations which are involved in creating a real world product. I was very insistent on having a specifically curved shaped for the main section. Even though this would have a big undercut problem if it was to be made out of one part. I explored various ways of producing this and settled on 2 parts which would be ultrasonic welded together, to escape this problem. I created a rapid prototype model of my product which really helped to prove I had the right dimensions and shape. The final design is a cup where the lid can be screwed on the top or bottom to add extra stability. All the parts are made out of ABS and I included a simple diagram of how the mould would come apart from the larger section. As it is not always apparent and proves the principle. The mould has different surface finishes to create a textured surface under the curved feature which adds a little defining detail to the design. ![Tip and Turn Manufacture](//images.contentful.com/1gvc9x9hfuhs/1rlMxodAakgK8icqgygA4/9ed1688062acfcd31d66aa18b0fcd107/tip-and-turn-manufacture.jpg) ![Tip and Turn](//images.contentful.com/1gvc9x9hfuhs/4N5qw2OX1SuaK4yS6uQQAu/5d9e0a82b3e68cd3e13929ae58e252c6/tip-and-turn.jpg) ![Tip and turn Dimensions](//images.contentful.com/1gvc9x9hfuhs/5zhHqsjWyAmyUACYwqSuYs/66f5df0c715a11b3ef15129003acaf7a/tip-and-turn-dimensions.jpg)","tags":["5xHKYRK4mIKOUk4cGUicKM","3uq1OiURL2Emome0aii20c","25thetwt7momiQkk88W0U6"],"categories":["6dDdjcgUneMUWiGK2EmyyU","6Prj0oBP3OAue8UwSMKAaq"]},"4cn8DZ0Rzis8MscaWkiwcg":{"id":"4cn8DZ0Rzis8MscaWkiwcg","createdAt":"2017-07-17T16:56:29.384Z","updatedAt":"2017-07-17T16:56:29.384Z","contentType":"project","title":"Graftt - Working as the Design Officer","slug":"graftt","displayDate":"2015-03-30T07:43:12.000Z","thumbnailImage":"2VqtzZ6ndewwMMQkKuCYYw","excerpt":"In September 2014 I joined the small startup Graftt as the Design Officer.

Based in a warehouse around Shoreditch, it had the classic east London tech startup vibe. At the time Graftt was an agency that developed internet of things (IoT) products and consulted in design and technology. When I joined was a team of 3; myself, the founder and chief strategist and an experienced designer. During my time there I was involved in several projects:\n\n*   [DataLight](https://charliejackson.com/datalight/) - A connected light for the workplace that uses light to represent business data\n*   [Product Stories](https://charliejackson.com/productstories/) - A video and audio podcast in which we interviewed entrepreneurs about how they built their products\n*   Graftt website - Our home for telling the world about our services\n*   [TalkLab website](https://charliejackson.com/talklab/) - A website we built for the non profit organisation TalkLab\n*   Pitch support - Doing the research, support work and participating in client brainstorms for dozens of client pitches\n*   Blog posts - Keeping the Graftt blog populated with compelling content\n\nI learned loads from working as Graftt, as it was one of my first jobs not working for my own startup. Primarily my professional skills, team skills and attention to detail vastly increased. This was also the time that I started getting heavily into programming and electronics, having built several websites and spent a lot of time programming Raspberry Pi's. My writing style also improved greatly, as I was encouraged to read and make use of the ideas in the [Pyramid Principle](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pyramid-Principle-Logic-Writing-Thinking/dp/0273710516), a fantastic book about conveying ideas in the most efficient way possible. One of the skills I developed towards the end of my time at Graftt was my camera, film and video editing skills. As we produced a video and audio podcast, [Product Stories](https://charliejackson.com/productstories/), where our founder would interview entrepreneurs about how they built their products. During this I was solely responsible for all the recording and editing, which was a great way of getting better and having something great to show for it. I left Graftt in March 2015 when we ran out of money. Here is the official intro to Graftt for anyone who is particularly interested:\n\n> \"We are a Strategic Design Consultancy that creates products, services and experiences using understanding and technology to bring meaningful change to the world. To do this we build interdisciplinary project teams that take a research-led approach and work outwards from the customer. Our processes are always lean, meaning a strong focus on prototyping and experiential development. And we practise what we preach – so we will always be starting new ventures that feed back into our consultancy work. Structurally, we are a combination of three different organisational models – part-design agency, part-management consultancy and part-technology startup. We chose this hybrid structure as it allows us to meet the challenges of our clients with flexibility and resilience. It is a reflection of our belief that to bring new things into the world, we must begin work way before a brief has been created and finish long after a prototype has been delivered. And why are we called Graftt? Well, graft means “hard work” in Northern English slang. We believe that all great things come from hard work, and that they take time, effort and focus.\"","tags":["4CeSpNd1jiGcqc64EakuGW","1x1OM8qqrmOSgUYYkW66sm","5IUNB6MaOWcmwSeCUGo6kq","5fdbp4QhsAuGICw6Waiikg","3OLLjscAwoagE0wyOgImG2"],"categories":["6dDdjcgUneMUWiGK2EmyyU","1shdGmOD4Ago2Se2mKu4MK","54PQi97PNCmiuSI2Sa8meS","6Prj0oBP3OAue8UwSMKAaq","5VIUyoyN44uGc24uqs8EYq","5nD8Tpyd5CGywCyM2SYQmy"]},"4y69Qk0gaAsiIEeAESmECK":{"id":"4y69Qk0gaAsiIEeAESmECK","createdAt":"2017-07-17T16:56:29.372Z","updatedAt":"2017-07-17T16:56:29.372Z","contentType":"project","title":"Nottingham - BEng in Product Design and Manufacture at The University of Nottingham","slug":"nottingham","displayDate":"2012-06-20T14:13:48.000Z","thumbnailImage":"5Oi2z2g0FyIqKeIs4uOM8m","excerpt":"In September 2009 I headed off to Nottingham to study a engineering degree in product design and manufacture.

A course that is halfway between mechanical engineering and an BA in product design, also known as industrial design. Throughout my 3 years there I had studied modules in the areas of:\n\n*   Engineering mathematics\n*   Mechanics\n*   Materials and material forming\n*   Electromechanical systems\n*   Physical and cognitive ergonomics\n*   [Sketching](https://charliejackson.com/sketchwork/)\n*   Modeling techniques\n*   3D/computer Modeling\n*   Photoshop, Illustrator, 3Ds Max, Pro Engineer and Google Sketchup\n*   Production management\n*   Rapid prototyping and modern manufacturing techniques\n*   Sustainable manufacture\n\nThe best parts of the course lay in the design projects we did as both individual and group work. With these projects we were given briefs from the tutors of from nationwide competitions and would go through the entire design, prototyping and pitching process. During our studio time, the University got in industry experts to help advise us alongside the tutors. Here's a brief run down of some of the projects, most of which I have written about elsewhere on this site:\n\n*   [Nottingham city bus shelter](https://charliejackson.com/busshelter/)\n*   Branded car emergency pack\n*   [Hostess trolley](https://charliejackson.com/kitchen-block-a-modern-day-hostess-trolley/)\n*   3D printed camping cup\n*   [Mobile market stall](https://charliejackson.com/marketstall/)\n*   [Electronic notepad for \"Tomorrow's Workplace\"](https://charliejackson.com/e-lectronic-notepad-a-smart-e-paper-notebook/)\n*   [A range of wifi, colour changing lights](https://charliejackson.com/lumine/)\n*   Baby monitor\n*   Hand blender\n*   Elastic band powered toy kart\n*   Injection moulded mobile phone holder\n\nThe main part of my degree was the major project in the last year. This was a 6 month long project, where we got to choose our own problem to try and solve and work on it full time until our final presentation. I decided to look at designing products for the smart home of the future. Which resulted in [Lumine](https://charliejackson.com/lumine/), a range of wifi colour changing lights. ![Lumine overview image](//images.contentful.com/1gvc9x9hfuhs/3b0iszDBzOOuIGkigKkOYQ/9964315f0cf1eadaa1631b4090c0cc70/lumine-overview.jpg) Another big part was the dissertation, for this I looked at the future of home design. This involved a lot of research on the history of art and design, in which I ended up creating a giant pin board timeline to help collect my thoughts and visualise trends. You can read more about my dissertation and the future of home design on [this post](https://charliejackson.com/dissertation/). During my time at Nottingham I also founded my startup Nine Studios. As I new I wanted to work on my own ideas and be part of the startup scene. Initially Nine Studios started as a design consultancy and I worked on a few graphic design projects, building logos and website designs. You can see the full history of Nine Studios and our current work on my [post about it](https://charliejackson.com/nine-studios-my-tech-startup/). ![Nine Studios Mood Board](//images.contentful.com/1gvc9x9hfuhs/4xdSknSLjyGEq6yAWaSwAy/d6609b5cf0da610b3d3f8f6422e3f570/nine-studios-mood-board.jpg) In the end I achieved a 1st class degree with honours and graduated top of my class in 2012\\.

This was a crazy time of transformation from the geeky little boy in green glasses doing magic, to the much more geeky maths, physics and design teenager who was in the Big Band and house prefect. Luckily though it was interspersed with moments of detentions, being suspended for calling a teacher ugly during a fire drill, being on the rugby and tennis teams and messing about on Spanish and German trips. What follows is a brief run down of the various things that happened at Brentwood:\n\n## A Levels\n\nIn 2007 I started my A-levels, and for some reason had decided to do further mathematics, physics and product design. After the first year in the lower 6th I had already got an A grade in the entire maths A Level and decided to stop doing the further maths bit during the upper 6th. This meant I only did 2 subjects in my last year, physics and product design, whilst still getting 3 A levels, which is all a university wanted. I feel like I cheated the system, as everyone else still had 3 subjects in the last year and still got the same amount of A levels as me. So much free time! Mwuhahahahaha. I ended up finishing Brentwood with the following A Levels:\n\n*   Maths - A\n*   Product Design - A\n*   Physics - B\n\n## GCSE's\n\nGCSE's were a fairly dull affair in general. We had no free periods during this time and were forced to do exams in all sorts of subjects you didn't care about at the time. I did the exams between 2006 and 2007 with the following results:\n\n*   Mathematics - A*\n*   Double Science - A*, A*\n*   Spanish - A*\n*   Systems and Control (Electronics) - A*\n*   Religious Education - A*\n*   Geography - A*\n*   Art - A\n*   English Language - A\n*   English Literature - B\n\n## Product Design\n\nProduct design and electronics were 2 of my favourites subjects at school. Which I guess makes sense seeing as I went on to do [BEng in Product Design and Manufacture at the University of Nottingham](https://charliejackson.com/nottingham/). During this time I ended up doing:\n\n*   Designing and building a modular desk system\n*   Built a waterproof speaker specifically for mounting on sailing dinghies\n*   Made a working portable audio mixer\n*   Won the gold award for the nationwide Engineering Education Scheme\n*   Was on the winning Team of the May Gurney Technology Competition\n*   Got the Brentwood School Technology prize in my final year\n\n![Desk Design](//images.contentful.com/1gvc9x9hfuhs/6nFh4FG8DYguSCuW4EOyOU/b860367538852cdfe25440d9fe7d5250/desk-design.jpg)\n\n## Music\n\nWhen I started at Brentwood I decided to learn the saxophone, probably because I liked the way it sounded on the Simpsons. I ended up with weekly lessons at school and worked my way up to Jazz grade 5, and was working on grade 8 just before I left. I had also joined the school's Big Band, which regular performed to audiences of up to a few hundred people. The best part about being in the big band was getting to go on the music trip to Nuremberg in Germany. Where we were all excited as 16 year olds on a school trip but we could legally drink alcohol! Things got very messy and I'm sure we didn't play to our best ability when it came to the performances :s ![Saxophone](//images.contentful.com/1gvc9x9hfuhs/Ml1JRvUe2W0oUeII2KaQy/6769b0b333edf858b31bf33cc2bd2aa6/saxophone.jpg)\n\n## Sport\n\nI was in the school tennis and rugby teams throughout my time at Brentwood. I ended up being the first seed in my year at tennis, both in singles and doubles, representing the school in numerous matches.  Tennis became my main focus towards my latter years at Brentwood, as I was working part time as a tennis coach at the time, so it took most of my focus. Rugby I just did for a bit of banter, played fly half and did all the kicking and bossing the backs around. ![Rugby](//images.contentful.com/1gvc9x9hfuhs/NKIqaRxb4iGEwayAosg0u/f82fb5f87deaa4d23d3e41c944b95d5b/rugby.jpg)\n\n## Viki\n\nSchool is where I met my now wife [Viki Bell](https://vikibell.com). One of the main reasons I chose to go to Brentwood in the first place was because it was the best mixed school I could get into. And I ended up having to travel about an hour on the school bus to and from school everyday because of this choice. However it all played out well in the end, as I started going out with Viki when we were 15\\. This made it much easier to get to school, as she lived super close by, so if I stayed over I could get a lie in :)\n\n## Misc\n\nOther more minor points of note include:\n\n*   Being part of the CCF (schools armed forces), in the Navy branch and having to do drills and things every Friday. Best part was not having to where school uniform on Fridays, although the army uniform did make us look like twats\n*   The Spanish exchange trips were always good fun, and I can still scrounge by in Spanish speaking countries, but not as well as I use to\n*   Ended up going through the wall of our 6th form common room after jumping on a friends back and playing rodeo\n*   Accidentally pulling down a friends trousers and pants in front of the head of 6th form, still not sure how I didn't get a detention or something for that","tags":["56HrJfoBSMa0mIqM4AKWey","Jm2JqaMOWcOEis0a8wqAs","5yw8FhCaLm6C2sGwW6sOgo","7fWq37qLWoUCSweyGKqeyu","38t54XDmcwMMqKuKQG2sYw","GXkt2a2WSOGcs6yOEwoIe","Q2cSGA2J0q0MYCg8UqgI2"],"categories":["6dDdjcgUneMUWiGK2EmyyU","1ljdn2bY96oWyAw0SUsi0s","6Prj0oBP3OAue8UwSMKAaq"]},"6KCRRiOqZiCaMgkiIKEO0w":{"id":"6KCRRiOqZiCaMgkiIKEO0w","createdAt":"2017-07-17T16:56:29.356Z","updatedAt":"2017-07-17T16:56:29.356Z","contentType":"project","title":"Car Emergency Pack - Branding and Design Project","slug":"toyota","displayDate":"2010-11-08T15:09:29.000Z","thumbnailImage":"4Jk9dV7Iw0mg8skk0iw4gW","excerpt":"The brief for this 3 week project was to design a car emergency pack which consisted of a case, a pair of scissors, a torch and a medical pack.

We were to create a mood board for  particular car brand and directly apply aspects of the board to our designs. The whole project was about branding and making parts feel like a set. I chose Toyota as my brand and went to work studying their brand principles and analysing their products.  From this I created the following mood board. ![Toyota Mood Board](//images.contentful.com/1gvc9x9hfuhs/15WY5dm7hoAiEssigwMY2I/807fd003707299759fd381fd137f6eb3/toyota-mood-board.png) When it came to the designs, I took particular notice of the way the curves end and overhang other elements. This feature seemed quite consistent amongst the brand. I also liked the blue colour of the board and the black and metallic feel you can get from the image. I took these principles and created several concepts. My final design shown here applies these principles in a simple and elegant manner. We were also marked on the manufacturing feasibility of the product and the exploded view below, helps to show how the parts could be moulded and would fit together. This project was the first time I used Pro Engineer and 3DS Max to design and render one of my own designs. These images became and important part of my final display boards. ![Car Emergency Pack Explode View](//images.contentful.com/1gvc9x9hfuhs/fV8cC72IRqkGeuQ0WkSK2/0780c8cadef63474cebf589dceb4e37b/car-emergency-pack-explode-view.png) ![Car Emergency Pack Dimensions](//images.contentful.com/1gvc9x9hfuhs/3EL61P78msm08eWywCKSCM/452286b54ef74c5512618d2d4cac2ad3/car-emergency-pack-dimensions.png)","tags":["3uq1OiURL2Emome0aii20c","25thetwt7momiQkk88W0U6"],"categories":["6dDdjcgUneMUWiGK2EmyyU","6Prj0oBP3OAue8UwSMKAaq"]},"1EVVmvstmkmakCyqeYEgQE":{"id":"1EVVmvstmkmakCyqeYEgQE","createdAt":"2017-07-17T16:56:28.499Z","updatedAt":"2017-07-17T16:56:28.499Z","contentType":"project","title":"Desk Design - A Level Design Project","slug":"desk","displayDate":"2009-05-10T12:43:23.000Z","thumbnailImage":"2kY2dpBSP60cuAC6eoCo0k","excerpt":"This was my A level design project whilst still at school.

I've always been insistent on reorganising and changing my workplace to get the most efficient use of space for the specific task I was doing. Taking this I gave myself the problem of creating an easily flexible and efficient workspace. My final design involved a desk system where you could add on separate modules, like levels, drawers and pull out sections. I created mini wooden prototypes to test out joining methods for the parts and modules. From these I took my first steps in CAD software and played around with Google Sketch Up until I could model and animate my design concept to figure out real world dimensions and fixings. ![Desk Explosion](//images.contentful.com/1gvc9x9hfuhs/1DuduIszjmUYK0yuU4OgOM/7945ee0484e1766111e0edc534ebf139/desk-explosion.jpg) Being primarily a woodwork project this time I got the chance to play around with even more manufacturing techniques and different mechanical fixings. I really liked the way you could put in a lot of care and attention into the model in order to make it look and feel the best it could. To me, I was amazed that I had created something that felt like a real product and could actually use at home. This project helped me get an  A grade for my Product Design A Level. ![Desk Layout](//images.contentful.com/1gvc9x9hfuhs/328qqD2wacEW8eOIw6uyY4/5f35dea09cb70f1e3d2432673d5ce3c4/desk-layout.jpg) ![Desk Layout](//images.contentful.com/1gvc9x9hfuhs/69dNIqkOyWOm04YaAmwSmI/471f55afb17613fb6ee20bf99fe6eaf1/desk-layout.jpg) ![Desk Layout](//images.contentful.com/1gvc9x9hfuhs/5jEdXXjpSo8GucOaA0Si4I/158810deb193c8a6ace509cf5d838f07/desk-layout.jpg) ![Desk Mini Model](//images.contentful.com/1gvc9x9hfuhs/1Xz5Y9dnCUyykCgE6kOO0k/56503a1706f607cae6122b1e442989ae/desk-mini-model.jpg) ![Desk Mini Model](//images.contentful.com/1gvc9x9hfuhs/Eq17JBpfAy0Gms6YaIwCo/1e57e5960cc9998d1b2a5f64aed8b66c/desk-mini-model.jpg) ![Desk Model Workshop](//images.contentful.com/1gvc9x9hfuhs/6rcCA5r516sCuOkmA4s4ou/16ab9747645da1dc31e0e1978b1cefe4/desk-model-workshop.jpg)","tags":["3Ap3NyboLYaeQ0OK0IC8Ii","5XEav16jeg4QAwkSS2CWEw"],"categories":["6dDdjcgUneMUWiGK2EmyyU","6Prj0oBP3OAue8UwSMKAaq"]},"50kcNo9AVyEK2au8QC4Kug":{"id":"50kcNo9AVyEK2au8QC4Kug","createdAt":"2017-07-17T16:56:28.479Z","updatedAt":"2017-07-17T16:56:28.479Z","contentType":"project","title":"Portfolios","slug":"portfolio","displayDate":"2016-04-16T11:42:06.000Z","thumbnailImage":"52H1ynXiSAESCa8UkCmm2Q","excerpt":"Over the years I've had to create several portfolios showcasing my work, for jobs, shows etc. I thought this would be a nice place to link to them all and see how they have changed.","content":"![](//images.contentful.com/1gvc9x9hfuhs/52H1ynXiSAESCa8UkCmm2Q/4ecb8d35e60081ad1145a26e11fe2ea1/charlie-jackson-portfolio.jpg) Over the years I've had to create several portfolios showcasing my work, for jobs, shows etc. I thought this would be a nice place to link to them all and see how they have changed.

I got to choose my own problem and being a keen sailor I decided to tackle the problem of having an easily portable way of playing music on small dinghies. The course was very practically orientated and was a very good introduction for me to see what I could design and make myself in a workshop. Being my first experience in product design I played around with different approaches to design and got hands on making models, very quickly. After my initial designs and models I started work on my final prototype. The basic design is quite simple as shown below. The 2 circular ends hold the speakers behind an aluminium case, rubber seal and screw on lid which helps to allow a tight seal for an MP3 player to be housed. ![Sailing Sound System](//images.contentful.com/1gvc9x9hfuhs/4pU2coSAzKgQwQGCa8aA26/815d46cc6a4efec6ac59f1b9a59a4e9e/sailing-sound-system.jpg) ![Charlie Jackson Annealing](//images.contentful.com/1gvc9x9hfuhs/ESlSn19jhIyI0Q2ueaQuE/d76fa65a0432bf4e54f5e0029d569564/charlie-jackson-annealing.jpg)","tags":["4G0dxA33wAO2esiyEcUgO0","5XEav16jeg4QAwkSS2CWEw"],"categories":["6dDdjcgUneMUWiGK2EmyyU","1ljdn2bY96oWyAw0SUsi0s","6Prj0oBP3OAue8UwSMKAaq"]},"1nPtfNeg80yi0C0K2MCyUq":{"id":"1nPtfNeg80yi0C0K2MCyUq","createdAt":"2017-07-17T16:56:27.419Z","updatedAt":"2017-07-17T16:56:27.419Z","contentType":"project","title":"Life Tree - My Research on Happiness","slug":"lifetree","displayDate":"2015-04-28T10:14:25.000Z","thumbnailImage":"3oKbYqik3662yQmIQsSMoK","excerpt":"I’ve been doing a lot of reading and research recently on happiness and I thought it’s only right to share some of the things I’ve learnt.

I’m trying to simplify it much more though, as 17 areas is a bit too much.\u003c/span>\n\n## 1\\. Develop a positive mindset\n\n\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first area, develop a positive mindset, is by far the most important area and accounts for most of our happiness. Here's a brief overview of developing a positive mind:\u003c/span> \u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fLJsdqxnZb0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\u003c/iframe>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shawn Achor talks about happiness at work but his ideas travel much further than just for work. Developing a positive mindset accounts for 90% of our happiness. The 7 key ways I have found to do this are:\u003c/span>\n\n*   \u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Write down 3 new things you are grateful for every day\u003c/span>\n*   \u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Relive positive experiences\u003c/span>\n*   \u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exercise regularly\u003c/span>\n*   \u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meditate every day\u003c/span>\n*   \u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perform random acts of kindness everyday\u003c/span>\n*   Act on the principles you believe in\n*   Respect yourself and others\n\n### Write down 3 new things you are grateful for every day\n\nA great app for this is the [5 Minute Journal](https://www.intelligentchange.com/products/the-five-minute-journal), which encourages you to do this and has some additional things you can log in your life.\n\n### Relive positive experiences\n\nThe act of writing down the positive things that happen to you, trains your mind over time to look out for the positives in daily life rather than the negatives. An additional plus is the long term, nostalgic benefit of being able to revisit these journal entries. Which can help us relive those positive moments and experience a bit of that positivity again through recollection. I'd suggest the excellent iOS and macOS app [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com/), otherwise you can just use any note taking app such as [Evernote](https://evernote.com). Here's my quick action point list for reliving positive experiences:\n\n*   Do fun things\n    *   Every week look at what fun things you could do in the next 2 weeks\n    *   Every month look at what bigger things you could do in the year\n*   Record them\n    *   Take photos\n    *   Keep a journal of your positive experiences\n    *   Post (privately if you wish) memories and the things you do to social media\n*   Relive them\n    *   Get digital photo frames for you home\n    *   Print out photos and display them\n    *   Regularly change you phone/computer backup images\n\n### Exercise regularly\n\nNot only does exercise release chemicals that can make you enjoy it and makes every day activities easier, the mental benefits of thinking that you are a person who does exercise and subconsciously feeling that you are a better person than other people can work wonders for increasing your positive mindset.\n\n### Meditate every day\n\nThe [Calm app](https://www.calm.com/) is a great way to get started, with guided meditation. [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) is another popular app.\n\n### Perform random acts of kindness everyday\n\nSuch as: Helping a stranger, messaging an old contact or sending a genuine message of thanks to someone you know.\n\n### Act on the principles you believe in\n\nWe can often feel like we are letting ourselves down when we fail to live up to our own expectations. To develop a positive mindset we need to live up to our expectations and act on the principles we believe in. For this you need to have an idea of what principles you want to live your life by and constantly remind yourself of them so that you can keep doing them. I follow the following action points:\n\n*   Keep a list of the principle you believe in\n*   Update that list every month\n*   Set up reminders from that list to alert you every day or so, just reminding you of a specific principle\n\n### Respect yourself and others\n\nForcing yourself to look for the positives in yourself and other people will slowly train your mind to subconsciously notice the positives in people more often. And noticing the positives more than the negatives will help develop your positive mind.\n\n* * *\n\n## 2\\. Do what you love\n\nIt's pretty simple, doing what you enjoy will make you happy. However so many of us don't do this or aren't even fully aware of the things we enjoy. Here are my action list of how to do the things you love.\n\n*   Keep a list of the things you enjoy doing\n    *   Have a specific bulleted list somewhere of all the things you enjoy doing. Keep it somewhere like on your notes app, Google Docs etc.\n*   Do them\n    *   This is probably the hardest part. Getting round to actually doing things you enjoy. I'd recommend checking the list every week and seeing if you can do one or a few things from it every week. Maybe set a reminder on your phone to check it.\n*   Review this list and how often you do the things on them every few months\n    *   Set up a reminder that occurs every few months for you to add/remove things from this list.\n*   Make sure your job is something you enjoy doing and review this every few months\n    *   This is one of the hardest things for many people to do and can be very hard to motivate and convince people to radically change their job. For this reason I'd rather recommend some resources to look at rather than talking about it here:\n        *   [The Four Hour Work Week](http://fourhourworkweek.com/) - Book\n\n* * *\n\n## 3\\. Work on your relationships\n\nSurrounding yourself with the people who make you happy and who have a positive impact on your life, is a strong factor in your personal happiness. Here are my main thoughts on this aspect:\n\n*   Cut out anyone who doesn't have a positive impact on your life.\n    *   A lot of the stress that goes on in our lives is actually caused by other people and the way we feel about their judgement/feelings about us. By removing these people from your life you can dramatically reduce your stress levels, which makes your positive/negative life balance much better.\n*   Be very open, honest and prompt about any conflicts you may have with someone you care about.\n    *   By not resolving conflicts in your relationships as soon as they appear, you are introducing that conflict as a subtle stress in your life until it gets resolved. The same goes for not being honest in order to avoid conflict.\n*   Make sure you are regularly spending time with the people you care about.\n    *   It can be too easy to get immersed in your work life and the stress that surrounds it. So much so that all you end up wanting to do with your spare time is relax, without many people stressing you out. However maintaining your positive relationships and keeping those people in your life will do a lot of good in reducing your stress levels, helping you relax and enjoying life.\n    *   You can keep a list of all the friends and family who are a positive influence on your life. And regularly (I have a bi-weekly reminder) check that list in order to prompt you if there is someone you haven't seen or contacted in a while.\n\n* * *\n\n## 4\\. Develop your romantic/sexual relationship(s)\n\nMany people never think about working to get better at sex with a partner(s). Or fall into the trap of not working on their romantic relationships. Here's my quick action list of ways to improve your romantic/sexual relationship(s):\n\n*   Read up on sex\n*   Experiment\n*   Regularly ask for feedback and what your partner(s) likes\n*   Make sure your are regularly spending quality time with your partner(s)\n    *   Set a bi-weekly reminder to make sure you have some quality time planned in with your partner for the next 2 weeks.","tags":["1neKxCHbGMuqku4i8YYSm0","4F89bwNbpeUGgk0qWK8M2i","699twCB6feWYqgWaieWQqa","w6YF5Y43a8agMQw2Q0Ayw","4rF4mYwm3KWAgeyWqgMoWY"],"categories":["6ArwpmEeIgCmaUeO8UIMgY","4Rqs2ScZnaAG8OmM464Sa2"]},"6MJ8mWkEeIuYoCC4OM0WSm":{"id":"6MJ8mWkEeIuYoCC4OM0WSm","createdAt":"2017-07-17T16:56:27.362Z","updatedAt":"2017-07-17T16:56:27.362Z","contentType":"project","title":"Audio Engineering - My Time Building a Recording Studio","slug":"audioengineering","displayDate":"2008-07-03T11:24:24.000Z","thumbnailImage":"y94JmRguqGKQGCUiwgMmy","excerpt":"When I was around 17/18, I got really into recording and audio engineering.

When installed globally you can then use it by running e.g: `cj install react-js` Here's a run down of the commands so far:\n\n*   install - Wrapper around [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) so that I can install any Yeoman templates that are dependencies of the cj module. The main benefit of this is that you do not have to install each generator/template manually first, as they are all bundled within this utility.\n*   run - A wrapper around [global-commands](https://www.npmjs.com/package/global-commands), another one of my npm modules that lets you run common commands from any directory, so you don't need to \"cd\" to some potential long and hard to remember directory first\n*   update - A command that will update all the node packages in the file you run it from. This will always update to the latest version rather than respecting the specified semver number.\n*   update --self - Is an option that can be passed to update the cj-cmd module.\n\nAt some point I'm looking to add system checks into this plugin so that it will download/install or tell you what your system needs in order to run various projects. This will help me maintain a consistent development environment and stop forgetting which Atom plugins I have installed at work but not on my home machine yet.

But in the last 70 days I have been doing 5-10 minutes every day to find out what the prolonged benefits of daily meditation are. Here's what I've found:\n\n*   I can prioritise and organise much better\n    *   This was one of my key stress factors, always wanting to do too much and getting overwhelmed with all the tasks I felt needed to get done. Meditation has helped me to realise that a task may not actually be important and has helped me to define a clear priority of tasks. Greatly reducing my stress.\n*   I can stay focused for longer, so I'm more efficient\n*   My breathing is much better\n*   My mind is calmer, and doesn't race around as much\n    *   Slower more deliberate though\n*   I am more forgiving, and more likely to see the good in people\n*   I am less worried about the future, and am focusing more on the present\n*   I am more honest with myself about my own thoughts, opinions and emotions\n\nMy daily practice looks like:\n\n*   Grabbing one of the giant pillows [Viki](http://vikibell.com) made from our honeymoon\n*   Sitting cross legged\n*   Opening the Calm app and picking one of the 5, 10 or 15 minute sessions. My favourites are:\n    *   Calm Light\n        *   Less talk\n    *   Timed Meditation\n        *   No talk\n    *   Choices\n        *   Guided talk session around noticing distractions\n    *   Body Scan\n        *   Guided talk session focusing on awareness of your entire body\n\n![Calm Stats](//images.contentful.com/1gvc9x9hfuhs/5noQ6RvOh28wOEAyYIkIUQ/351d618530b306a5be5ff27fde329dfe/calm-stats.jpg)","tags":["1neKxCHbGMuqku4i8YYSm0","1zQDToa9WImyAQawSMoU66","5T4X7mobIWkGY8qouMIeM2"],"categories":["6ArwpmEeIgCmaUeO8UIMgY","6tCmfDtKgweSguk8iaGg46"]},"6viaheqrkWG0aUoA4cEK6y":{"id":"6viaheqrkWG0aUoA4cEK6y","createdAt":"2017-07-17T16:56:24.322Z","updatedAt":"2017-07-17T16:56:24.322Z","contentType":"project","title":"Story - Combining My Instagram Story for a Month","slug":"story","displayDate":"2017-05-14T21:01:54.000Z","thumbnailImage":"3q6dDY7Ysgq602qseWq6I4","excerpt":"In April I decided to use Instagram stories to create a fun video of random moments each day.
